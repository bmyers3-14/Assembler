readme.txt CS30000 Assembler

The assembler created by Paice Fuller, Benjamin Myers and Jacob Warren was created in C++ v11 and newer. We used a combination of development environments; linux shell(putty using vim) and visual studio environment. The file "main.cpp" can be complied in any C++ complier. We used the built in visual studio compiler as well the GNU command in linux "g++" using the version override to version 11. If using visual studio, the user can just use the built in run/compile command. In linux you need to run the make file by typing "make run".

To compile: g++ main.cpp
To Run:  ./a.out
Input the name of the text file.
